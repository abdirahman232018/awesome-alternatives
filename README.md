## Project Overview
- **Goal**: Provide a structured way to compare American products with their Canadian or international counterparts.
- **Technology Stack**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON data.
- **Features**:
  - Product cards displaying name, description, and alternative details.
  - Expandable data structure in JSON, allowing easy addition of new fields.
  - Responsive layout with minimal styling.
  - **Future Enhancements**: Integration of ad placements and improved product management.

## Installation and Usage
1. **Clone** or **download** this repository.
2. **Open** `index.html` directly in your browser, or run a local server (e.g., `python -m http.server`) to avoid CORS restrictions.
3. **Customize** the `products.json` file in the `data/` folder to add your own products and alternatives.
4. **Modify** the styling in `css/styles.css` or logic in `js/script.js` as needed.

## Future Development
We are actively planning improvements and additional features for Awesome Alternatives:
- **Ads Section**:  
  A dedicated section for ads will be integrated in future releases. This area will feature targeted promotions for Canadian alternatives and local products, and may include dynamic content updates.
  
- **Enhanced Submission Form**:  
  The current product submission form will be expanded to support:
  - **Product Updates**: Not only adding new products but also editing existing product details.
  - **Image URL Updates**: Improved support for product image URLs, with validations and potentially an image upload option.
  - **Backend Integration**: Implementation of API endpoints (using Node.js, Express, or another server-side technology) to persist updates to the `products.json` file or a database.
  
- **Image Handling Improvements**:  
  Future versions will include enhanced image handling:
  - Better integration for displaying product images from specified URLs.
  - Optional image upload functionality to allow users to provide images directly.
  
- **Additional Enhancements**:
  - Improved filtering and search functionality.
  - Expanded product data fields for even richer comparisons.
